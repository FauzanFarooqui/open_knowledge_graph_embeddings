############### DATASET


# Configure the default dataset class for all splits, with the following choices:
#
# OneToNMentionRelationDataset:
#
#   Dataset format:
#
#   This dataset class works especially with KGE dataset where the entities
#   can be realized with different alternative mentions.
#
#   The data format contains the following TAB separated fields per line:
#   5 TAB separated columns, COL 4 and COL 5 are lists of space seperated ids:
#
#   COL 1		COL 2           COL 3		COL 4			COL 5
#   entity id	relation id	    entity id	subj entity ids	obj entity ids
#
#   This dataset can also be used for standard KGE tasks, then COL 4 and
#   COL 5 are identical to COL 1 and COL 3
#
#
#   Batch construction:
#
#   The set of answer entities of all examples in the batch are shared accross
#   all examples of the the batch as true or false labels.
#
#   For example, given a batch containing the subject-relation prefix (1, 2) with
#   object answers [3, 4], and relation-object suffix (4, 5) with subject
#   answers [1, 7, 8], then the batch will be constructed as
#
#   potential batch shared entity answers [1, 3, 4, 7, 8]
#
#   sp prefixes: (1, 2) labels: [0, 1, 1, 0, 0]
#
#   po prefixes: (4, 5) labels: [1, 0, 0, 1, 1]
#
#
#   Apart from batch_size, the batch construction is influcenced by the following
#   two parameters:
#
#   Minimum label size for *batch construction*, i.e. when are less batch shared
#   entity answers than min_size_batch_labels, then new randomly sampled entities
#   are added to that set.
#
#   min_size_batch_labels: 4096
#
#
#   Maximium label size during *creation of training examples*, i.e. if a
#   (subject,relation) prefix has more than max_size_prefix_label number of true
#   answers the answers are split up into chunks. The (subject,relation) example
#   is then repeated during training for each chunk.
#
#   max_size_prefix_label: 64
